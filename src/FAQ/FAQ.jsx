                {`In short, we want to make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to buy tickets the limit's there to keep the first person in the queue from 
                buying up all the best seats and leaving nothing for everyone behind them! Ticket limits apply to ensure fair access to tickets for fans
                , and as a measure to minimise ticket scalping. The ticket limits are set by the event organizers. 
                If the number of people in your party exceeds the ticket limit, another member of the group would need to book with another Ticketmaster account.
                If your party is making multiple bookings, unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that all the seats will be together 
                especially for big events where tickets are likely to sell out very quickly.`}

                Why is there a time limit to purchase tickets online?

                This time limit gives all fans an equal opportunity to secure tickets for the event. Remember to keep track of time and move through the processing pages as quickly as possible. 
                When you have exceeded the time limit, any tickets in your cart will be removed and you will need to reload the purchase page and try again.  `}
